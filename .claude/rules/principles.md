# Principles

> When no rule covers it, fall back here.

## 1. Single Source of Truth
Every piece of knowledge lives in exactly one place.
Duplicate = debt. If it exists somewhere, point to it.

## 2. Progressive Disclosure
Surface minimum context, link to depth.
CLAUDE.md → rules/ → inline docs. Never front-load everything.

## 3. Search Before Create
Before making anything new, check what already exists.
Search the workspace. Ask if unsure. Reuse > reinvent.

## 4. Smallest Footprint
Less is more. Fewer lines, fewer files, fewer dependencies.
If you can delete it without loss, it shouldn't exist.

## 5. Computed Over Stored
Prefer dynamic checks over static manifests.
Scan folders instead of maintaining registries.

## 6. Principles Over Rules
Rules are specific. Principles are general.
When rules conflict or are silent, principles decide.

## Applying Principles
- Creating something? → #3 Search Before Create, then #1 Single Source
- Adding content? → #4 Smallest Footprint, then #2 Progressive Disclosure
- Tracking state? → #5 Computed Over Stored
- Unsure what to do? → #6 this list, top to bottom
