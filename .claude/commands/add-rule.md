Add rule about: $ARGUMENTS

1. Check if rule already exists in:
   - ~/Documents/GitHub/.claude/rules/
   - ./claude/rules/ (project-specific)

2. Decide scope:
   - Applies to ALL projects → suggest updating global rules (read-only, tell user)
   - Project-specific → create `.claude/rules/[topic].md`

3. If creating new file:
   - Keep under 40 lines
   - Use tables and symbols (✅❌→)
   - Show draft, wait for approval

4. Update project CLAUDE.md with pointer:
   - Add one line to "Read When Needed" section
   - DO NOT add full rule content to CLAUDE.md

5. Never let project CLAUDE.md exceed 30 lines
