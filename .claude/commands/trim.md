Trim: $ARGUMENTS

Target (based on original size):
- Under 50 lines → minor cleanup only
- 50-100 lines → under 50
- 100-200 lines → under 80
- 200-500 lines → under 150
- 500+ lines → under 200 or 50% (whichever larger)

Steps:
1. Read the file, count lines
2. Remove: verbose words, redundant phrases, excessive examples
3. Use: lists with → (2 cols), tables (3+ cols), symbols (✅❌→), short phrases
4. Keep ALL meaning — never cut essential context
5. Show: before/after line count + target
6. Wait for approval before saving
